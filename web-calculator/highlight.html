        <h2>“College Life Against Pandemic”</h2>
    </strong>


    <p>There is nothing <strong>normal</strong> or routine about this academic year. Because of the
        <strong>pandemic</strong>, this fall has been different from any other, with some classes
        being in-person or mixed mode and some remote; the need to wear masks and observe <strong>social
            distancing</strong>; and the restrictions on gatherings. This pandemic
        is making college turn into something I never pictured it would be but I understand that having an
        <strong>online class</strong> and following <strong>pandemic rules</strong> are the only
        way we can <strong>get back to a normal college experience</strong> and <strong>continue our dreams in
            life</strong>.

        There are a lot of things that are being <strong>online class</strong> because of this <strong>online
            class</strong>. <strong>Classes</strong> are one thing. As a student, it is hard to handle this kind of
        circumstance.
        But <strong>thanks to God</strong> that I am belong to <strong>PN family</strong>. They are <strong>the one who
            caters</strong> to me to continue my . They provided everything, the best things that I need the most.
        But <strong>thanks to God</strong> that I am belong to <strong>PN family</strong>. They are <strong>the one who
            caters</strong> to me to continue my <strong>college life</strong>. They provided everything, the
        <strong>best things</strong> that I need the most.
        Even in my <strong>hard times</strong>, my <strong>co-scholars</strong> are always there by my side. Though I am
        not with my <strong>family</strong> right now, it is not too bad because I considered them as my <strong>new
            family</strong>.
        Because of this pandemic, the relationship between the whole Pn family becomes stronger than before. This
        pandemic let us experience what life is all about. <strong>Happy days to a sad year</strong>.

    <p>
        Because of this pandemic, I learned about <strong>how life goes through</strong>. Life that no one knows when it
        ends. As a student against this pandemic, all I need is to <strong>continue</strong> what I’ve started,
        follow rules and always go with the flow. I never think about the <strong>bad circumstances</strong> that happen
        currently, I just stick to thinking about the <strong>opposite situation</strong> that has a positive outcome.
        <strong>Be positive</strong> as always to have a <strong>better future</strong>. <strong>Success and happiness
            will always lie to us</strong>.
